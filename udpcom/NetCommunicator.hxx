/** Generic TCP/IP + packet (UDP or websocket) communication base class.

    This maintains communication with one or more peers, verifying
    message arrival, with a re-send option when messages are lost.

    Derived classess NetCommunicatorMaster and NetCommunicatorPeer
    implement master functionality and peer functionality. The master
    opens a TCP/IP service to transmit configuration requests, and
    manages connections and start instructions for participation in
    the data transmission.

    Real-time data communication is over UDP or Websocket,
    with robustness against lost packages.

    @bug The implementation is not yet robust against a combination of
    aggressively creating and deleting entries (as stress-tested in
    TestMultiStream), and numerous lost packages (stress-tested with
    the -DBUILD_TESTOPT=ON option).

    Headers in the package have the following data:

    - uint16_t crc check
    - uint32_t group magic number
    - int32_t  sending offset, microseconds
    - uint32_t cycle counter
    - uint16_t (sending) peer id
    - uint16_t number of peers in this message cycle
    - uint32_t peer tick, time indication of peer

    Any header data beyond that is dependent on the client implementation.

    Sending logic and recovery is as follows:
    - on timeout at the master, the sending enters a recovery cycle where
      the last set of data is repeated. A nibble of the cycle counter is
      used to rotate through the repeats.
    - on receive failure at a peer (incomplete set of messages), a recovery
      request is sent. The master repeats the *previous* message cycle, and
      a flag in that message indicates that the peers should cycle back as
      well, until that gets a confirm, and then continues with the message
      cycle in which the recovery was requested, then continues to
      normal sending.

    Sending error scenarios

    - message arrives late at a peer
      * the sending cycle is not completed in time, part of the messages
        may still be sent
      * the master sends a repeat cycle, with an update in the nibble
      * peers start reacting to the repeated cycle initiated by the master
      * all peers will react with or without error flag. Once the master
        has messages from all peers, normal sending continues if no error
        flag, or recovery as in the next description

    - message does not arrive at a peer
      * if an intermediate peer, and the message just before sending,
        the message cycle breaks, and we are back to a recovery scenario
        as above
      * if a peer that did not wait on this message for sending misses
        the message, it is detected at the next cycle, the peer sends
        a missed data flag
      * the master cycles back to the backup buffer (previous message),
        the message before that was received and confirmed, since the
        backup buffer only became backup after getting confirmation
        on that cycle. backup buffer is sent with an error flag
      * all nodes receiving the master message also switch to the
        backup buffer and send that.
      * if the cycle times out, the backup buffer is simply re-sent again
      * if the cycle does not time out (and new error flags from peers must
        be impossible), the buffer from the cycle in which the error was
        flagged is re-sent. Error recovery to backup is again possible
        if the error is flagged again.

    - peer crashes
      * one of the peers crashes, and will not send in a specific cycle
      * since the message is not sent, the master has a timeout
      * the master repeats the current message
      * the peer is connected through a configuration connection, and
        its breakage will be noticed by the master
      * when disappearance of the peer is noted, the number of peers in
        the master is reduced. peers will follow the master's lead on this
      * the master now concludes there are enough responses, and if no
        error is flagged on the previous cycle, the master advances to
        normal sending again

    Derived classes need to finalize virtual functions
    clientPackPayload and clientUnpackPayload, these receive and fill
    the UDP/Websocket/?? data. Additional functions to implement and
    extend the configuration communication over the TCP/IP server are
    defined in derived classes NetCommunicatorMaster and
    NetCommunicatorPeer.

    Derived classes DuecaNetMaster and DuecaNetPeer implement objects
    for communications between DUECA nodes in the same process/simulation.

    ChannelReplicatorMaster and ChannelReplicatorPeer implement
    communication between DUECA processes, i.e., an HLA-like service.
