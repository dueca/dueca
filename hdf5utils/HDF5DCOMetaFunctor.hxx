/** metafunctor to access DCO HDF5 facilities. Two modes of interaction

    - Get a datatype for writing the whole DCO object as a compound
      HDF5 datatype. Note that this only works for DCO objects with
      fixed-length strings, fixed length arrays (fixvector) and
      variable length arrays (limvector, varvector). DCO with fancier
      stuff like variable length strings, and stl containers do not
      allow this, and throw an exception.

    - Get a functor for reading a channel and writing the data into
      hdf5 format. This creates an hdf5 dataset for each variable in
      the DCO object. Again, limitations apply, the variables may not
      be dco objects for which a datatype cannot be obtained as
      described above. The hdf5 datasets are written as follows:

      @code
      path/tick            - for DUECA tick values
      path/data/<member1>  - first data member
      path/data/<membern>  - datasets for all data members

      for the future, if the DCO has a parent class, the structure
      is deepened further; note that currently the parent data is not
      written.
      path/<Parent>        - ONLY for DCO with parent class
      path/<Parent>/data   - all the members of this parent

      and possibly:
      path/<Parent>/<Parent2>/data   etc.
