     this file contains a list of all modules needed for your application
     on a specific machine. It commonly starts with the own project and
     modules.

     note that the comm-objects directories should *not* be listed here.
     The module name must be one of the folders in the given project.
     The project must contain the full path to a git repository

     If you encounter a message that a certain comm-objects folder cannot
     be found, use dueca-gproject borrow-project to add that project url.
     Alternatively, you can add a <project>..</project> tag here with the
     project url tag in it.

     If you need to check out from a specific branch, version or
     revision, add a <version>...</version> tag to specify branch, tag or
     the git hash.

     The URL for the project information matching the main project
     should be starting with the URL alias remote:/// . This means that
     it follows the original git clone, run `git remote -v` to find out
     where it is.
