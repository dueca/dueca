<!-- This file defines the mapping between DUECA nodes and their
     machine class (type of checkout, libraries, modules).

     Sparse checkout is always done for borrowed modules, but for the
     project's own modules it can be controlled. Typically, on a machine
     where you develop, it needs to be off, so you see all modules in the
     project. Compilation is only performed for the modules in the
     machine's modules.xml file, so this does not affect the size of the
     executable.
