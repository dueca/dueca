      From dueca 4.0.9, comm-objects.lst files interpretation is more flexible
      A line with only the name of a dco object (with .dco extension, and
      optionally a comment), will be interpreted to include a dco object from
      the "home" project, i.e., the project that also supplies the module.

      This policy will search for dco lines where the project matches the
      home project, and produce a match list, which can then be used to
      re-write the comm-objects.lst file, removing the project part from the
      dco specification.

      The advantage is that a project may be re-named or forked, and that the used
      dco's will no longer be pulled from the original project.

      From DUECA 4.0.9, the interpretation of including / dependency on another module
      is more flexible. The module name can be supplied without project name, in that
      case it is assumed that the module is from the home project. Doing this also
      simplfies re-naming / forking a project.
