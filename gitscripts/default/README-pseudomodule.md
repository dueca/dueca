# Pseudo module @module@

## What is a pseudo-module

In DUECA, a pseudo module does not contain code, and DUECA will not
attempt to compile and include the code files in the module folder.
This happens when there is no `CMakeLists.txt` file or no
`comm-objects.lst` file in this folder.

Pseudo modules are typically used to store data files that are or
could be shared among different projects, such as files for graphic
interfaces.

## This pseudo-module

You created this pseudo module, this would be a good place to describe
it.
