/** A base class from which users can derive Real-Time Workshop modules.

    The RTWModule base class implements the basic communication
    for a DUSIME module. By deriving from this class, using its
    methods to dermine the simulation state, and re-implementing
    applicable virtual methods, a fully DUSIME-aware class can be
    made, and objects of this class have coordinated start-stop
    abilities, the ability to calculate initial conditions and the
    ability for saving and restoring simulation state. A RTWModule
    can also store and restore RTW model state and parameters,
    from and to an xml description. This enables translation of
    states and parametersets between your DUECA simulation and
    the MATLAB workspace. */
