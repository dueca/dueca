/** A class "in-between" the dueca Module class, and
    Simulation/HardwareModule.

    There are many common tasks in the SimulationModule and
    HardwareModule classes. These common tasks, basic to the DUSimE
    capabilities are implemented in the DusimeModule class.

    Application developers should derive their modules from either a
    SimulationModule, for modules that implement a piece of simulation
    model, without doing IO, and from HardwareModule, for modules that
    may (but preferrably do not) implement a piece of simulation, and
    do IO and control of hardware.

    So: do not derive from DusimeModule directly.
