;; An IndexValuePair is a combination of an index, pointing to a
;; variable used in an initial condition or trim condition
;; calculation, and a value for this variable. IndexValuePair objects
;; are assembled into an IncoNotice object, which can be sent to and
;; from a central initial condition machine (with a generic
;; optimization method built in) that can calculate a global trim
;; condition for an aircraft, or any other dynamical system for that
;; matter.
