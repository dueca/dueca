/** A base class from which users can derive DUSIME modules.

    The SimulationModule base class implements the basic communication
    for a DUSIME module. By deriving from this class, using its
    methods to dermine the simulation state, and re-implementing
    applicable virtual methods, a fully DUSIME-aware class can be
    made, and objects of this class have coordinated start-stop
    abilities, the ability to calculate initial conditions and the
    ability for saving and restoring simulation state. */
