/** Webserver providing access to DUECA channels

    This server can define a number of URL's

    <table>
    <tr><th>URL</th><th>Description</th></tr>

    <tr>
    <td> /configuration </td>

    <td> After opening the configuration URL receives a JSON with all
    possible configured URL', in the sections "current", "read",
    "monitor" and "write". With the exception of "monitor", all
    endpoints also receive a description of the datatype.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> /current/name?entry=.. </td>

    <td> From a channel labeled "name", reads the current/latest data
    from the entry given. To get fresh data, write an empty message on the
    socket (will be discarded). Returns a JSON object with a member
    "tick", indicating the time tick and single set of data defined in
    a member "data". If omitted from the URL, the entry id is assumed
    to be 0. The entry may have been explicitly configured from the
    start script, or it was added by a channelwatcher (see later).
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr><td> /read/name?entry=.. </td>

    <td> From a channel labeled "name", and given entry, open a
    following read token. Receives all data as it comes in. Data push
    is provided by the DUECA side. For each new set of data, this
    returns a JSON array with objects containing time tick and set of
    data defined. The followdata entries were either specifically
    configured, or they are available from information obtained through
    the channelinfo URL
    </td></tr>

    <tr>
    <td> /info/name </td><td>

    Initiate information gathering for a specific channel. The watching
    capability (and thereby the url) must have been configured
    beforehand. For each entry in the channel, this returns a JSON
    object with the following elements; 'dataclass', for the class of
    object, 'entry', giving the entry number, 'typeinfo', with an
    array of type information (see below). </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> /write/name </td>

    <td> Open a write entry for a channel. The data type is specified
    in the start script of the module. The first message must be a
    json object with the member 'label'. Optionally, if this has a
    member 'ctiming' equal to true, the json client provides the
    timing. If this object has a member 'event' equal to false, an
    stream channel is created; in that case ctiming must be true.
    </td>

    </tr></table>

    Type information on the members of a dataclass, as returned by the
    channelinfo URL has the following structure:

    <table>

    <tr><th>key</th><th>Description</th></tr>

    <tr><td>name</td>
    <td> Name of the object's member</td></tr>

    <tr><td>type</td>
    <td> Type / data class of the object (c++ name)</td></tr>

    <tr><td>size (optional)</td>
    <td> For fixed size arrays, the size will be given</td></tr>

    <tr><td>array (optional)</td>
    <td> For array/list types, this value will be True</td></tr>

    <tr><td>typeinfo (optional)</td>
    <td> If the member is a nested DCO type, the typeinfo will be
    recursively presented in an array </td></tr>

    <tr><td>map (optional)</td>
    <td> If the member is a mapped type (e.g. stl map), this value
    will be true</td></tr>

    <tr><td>keytype (optional)</td>
    <td> If the member is a mapped type (e.g. stl map), this will
    contain the type / class of the used key </td></tr>
    </table>

    The instructions to create an module of this class from the script are:

    \verbinclude web-sockets-server.scm

    For the configuration of the server, the following options are available.

    <ol>
    <li> Manually setting up a /current URL. This specifies a channel
    entry from a specific channel. Meaningful only for channels with
    stream data (otherwise you might miss events if reading is not
    fast enough). </li>

    <li> Manually setting up a /read URL. Useful for following
    events and for obtaining all data written in a channel, e.g. for
    plotting. </li>

    <li> Setting up a /info URL. This can be read to follow
    changes, and to obtain (initially) the configuration of a
    channel. With the data one can choose to either open read
    URL's or current URL's; with an info URL configured, the
    corresponding read or current URL become available,
    given that the entries are created.
    </li>

    <li> Setting up a /write URL. The /write URL links the endpoint
    to the channel name. The first message to such a write URL needs the
    selection of dataclass, label, and timing control (timing supplied by
    the websockets side, or added by DUECA on basis of actual time).

    <li> Setting up a /write URL with preset/pre-defined entry. In this
    case, the channel is opened immediately, and a single entry is entered
    in the channel. This mode is useful if you want the channel entry to
    be present for the rest of the simulation. If for some reason the
    websockets connection is broken, a new connection will take its place.
    </ol>

    To provide static datafiles (e.g., to start off your javascript
    program), the module may be configured to act as a very simple web
    server as well, serving files from a single folder.
