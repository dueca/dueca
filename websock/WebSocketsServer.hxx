/** Webserver providing access to DUECA channels.

    There are two possible variants for this server, "web-sockets-server", which
    communicates with JSON-coded messages, and "web-sockets-server-msgpack", which
    uses msgpack (binary) messages for communication.

    This server can define a number of URL's:

    <table>
    <tr><th>URL</th><th>Description</th></tr>

    <tr>
    <td> /configuration </td>

    <td> After opening the configuration URL, the client receives a message with
    all possible configured URL's, in the sections "current", "read",
    "info", "write" and "write-and-read". 
    
    - current. These endpoints respond to a message from the client and then 
      produce a reply with data. Information in the information section includes:
      * endpoint
      * dataclass
      * information on the dataclass members
      * entry id (numeric)
    
    - read. These endpoints will produce messages at the rate of channel
      writing, or "throttled", when a time specification is given. Inforation in
      the information section includes:
      * endpoint
      * dataclass
      * type info
      * numeric entry id

    - info. These endpoints provide information on the entries in a specific
      channel. Inforation only consists of
      * endpoint

    - write. These endpoints provide information on entries that can be
      written to. Information consists of 
      * endpoint
      * dataclass
      * type info
      The latter two are only given if dataclass had been pre-configured. If
      not given, the dataclass needs to be specified in the first message from
      a client.

    - write-and-read. These endpoints can be used to establish a two-directional
      communication on two pre-defined channels. Information consists of
      * endpoint
      The first message upon opening needs to define the dataclass and label. 
      Once bi-directional communication is established, a message is sent with
      information on both the write direction and read direction.
    
    - granule. This is the last element in the struct, it defines the value in
      seconds of a single integer time increment.

    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> /current/name?entry=.. </td>

    <td> From a channel labeled "name", reads the current/latest data
    from the entry given. To get fresh data, write an empty message on the
    socket (will be discarded). Returns a object with a member
    "tick", indicating the time tick and single set of data defined in
    a member "data". If omitted from the URL, the entry id is assumed
    to be 0. The entry may have been explicitly configured from the
    start script, and thus its information was provided in the
    /configuration URL, or it was added by a channelwatcher, and information
    was provided in an /info/... url (see later).
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr><td> /read/name?entry=.. </td>

    <td> From a channel labeled "name", and given entry, open a
    following read token. Receives all data as it comes in. Data push
    is provided by the DUECA side. For each new set of data, this
    returns a JSON array with objects containing time tick and set of
    data defined. The read entries were either specifically
    configured (from /configuration), or they are available from
    information obtained through an info URL.
    </td></tr>

    <tr>
    <td> /info/name </td><td>

    Initiate information gathering for a specific channel. The watching
    capability (and thereby the url) must have been configured
    beforehand. For each entry in the channel, this returns a JSON
    object with the following elements; 'dataclass', for the class of
    object, 'entry', giving the entry number, 'typeinfo', with an
    array of type information (see below). </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> /write/name </td>

    <td> Open a write entry for a channel. The data type may be specified
    in the start script of the module. The first message must be a
    json object with the member 'label'. Optionally, if this has a
    member 'ctiming' equal to true, the json client provides the
    timing. If this object has a member 'event' equal to false, a
    stream channel is created; in that case ctiming must be true. If
    the datatype has not been configured beforehand, this needs to 
    be supplied in the first message.

    Optionally a /write/name entry can have been created as preset. In
    that case, the write token is created at startup of the server,
    and writing will be immediately available. The write token and
    channel entry will also persist after a connection is lost, and
    then a new connection can assume the write entry and continue.
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> /write-and-read/name </td>

    <td> This uses a single bi-directional websocket connection for
    writing a single entry and reading a corresponding entry in another
    channel. Information on the data types is provided after completion
    of the connection. This needs a DUECA module that acts as a server,
    monitors the channel that is written to from the websocket connection,
    and creates a matching entry in the reply channel.

    The first message from the client must contain a member "dataclass",
    indicating the DCO type the client wishes to write. An entry in the
    configured channel is created with this dataclass.

    After the server has created a corresponding entry in the reply
    channel, (having the exact same label), a websocket message is
    sent back, defining the read and write entry numbers, dataclass and
    type information. After this, messages can be written, to which
    the server module should provide replies.

    </td>

    </tr></table>

    Type information on the members of a dataclass, as returned by the
    channelinfo URL has the following structure:

    <table>

    <tr><th>key</th><th>Description</th></tr>

    <tr><td>name</td>
    <td> Name of the object's member</td></tr>

    <tr><td>type</td>
    <td> Type / data class of the object (c++ name)</td></tr>

    <tr><td>size (optional)</td>
    <td> For fixed size arrays, the size will be given</td></tr>

    <tr><td>array (optional)</td>
    <td> For array/list types, this value will be True</td></tr>

    <tr><td>typeinfo (optional)</td>
    <td> If the member is a nested DCO type, the typeinfo will be
    recursively presented in an array </td></tr>

    <tr><td>map (optional)</td>
    <td> If the member is a mapped type (e.g. stl map), this value
    will be true</td></tr>

    <tr><td>keytype (optional)</td>
    <td> If the member is a mapped type (e.g. stl map), this will
    contain the type / class of the used key </td></tr>
    </table>

    The instructions to create an module of this class from the script are:

    \verbinclude web-sockets-server.scm

    For the configuration of the server, the following options are available.

    <ol>
    <li> Manually setting up a /current URL. This specifies a channel
    entry from a specific channel. Meaningful only for channels with
    stream data (otherwise you might miss events if reading is not
    fast enough). </li>

    <li> Manually setting up a /read URL. Useful for following
    events and for obtaining all data written in a channel, e.g. for
    plotting. </li>

    <li> Setting up a /info URL. This can be read to follow
    changes, and to obtain (initially) the configuration of a
    channel. With the data one can choose to either open read
    URL's or current URL's; with an info URL configured, the
    corresponding read or current URL become available,
    given that the entries are created.
    </li>

    <li> Setting up a /write URL. The /write URL links the endpoint
    to the channel name. The first message to such a write URL needs the
    selection of dataclass, label, and timing control (timing supplied by
    the websockets side, or added by DUECA on basis of actual time).

    <li> Setting up a /write URL with preset/pre-defined entry. In this
    case, the channel is opened immediately, and a single entry is entered
    in the channel. This mode is useful if you want the channel entry to
    be present for the rest of the simulation. If for some reason the
    websockets connection is broken, a new connection will take its place.

    <li> Setting up a /write-and-read URL.
    </ol>

    To provide static datafiles (e.g., to start off your javascript
    program), the module may be configured to act as a very simple web
    server as well, serving files from a single folder. To get better
    compatibility with browsers, also configure the mime types for
    these files.
