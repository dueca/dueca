                          the requested time. Note that if you select
                          this reading mode, data will be kept in the
                          channel until it is read by your module;
                          thus there is an obligation to read or flush
                          data, otherwise excessive memory use
                          follows. */
    ReadReservation, /**< Sequentially read all data, from oldest to
                          newest, like ReadAllData. In addition, this
                          uses a reservation that needs to have been
                          made by the write token(s) that are
                          accessed, ensuring that data written before
                          the creation of this read token remains
                          available. For most user-created channels
                          this is seldom needed, since creation of
                          both reading and writing tokens takes place
                          first, and writing and reading only starts
                          after all tokens have been created. Some of
                          DUECA's own channels do use this, since
                          these channels are created at start-up, and
                          almost immediately used. */

                          have an opportunity to read it. */
    AdaptEventStream /**< Adapt to event or stream data, by using
                          ReadAllData for event type data, and
