/** Base class for user-created self contained objects in DUECA.

    A Module is a class that basically obeys to some simple DUECA
    rules (it listens to its Entity), and which can be created from
    Scheme or Python, one of the scripting languages used in
    DUECA. Note that for simulations, often the SimulationModule class
    -- derived from Module -- is used as a base class for application
    code.

    A Module can register one or more activities, and supply the
    conditions on which the activities must be invoked. In the
    activities the module's work is done; simulation, control, data
    processing, etc.

    For certain situations, it is good to know from which thread a
    module's method is called.

    <ul>

    <li> Modules are created from the main thread of DUECA. This
    thread handles script (Scheme or Python) interaction, thus the
    constructor and any methods listed in the ParameterTable are
    called from this thread. There is access to your data, but not
    much more at this phase.

    <li> After creation of all initial modules in DUECA, applicable
    graphics code is initialized. Typically a windowing toolkit like
    GTK2, gtk3, glut may be started. After that, the
    Module::complete() method is called. At this stage, windows using
    the graphics code may be opened.

    <li> Module control is done from the "admin" or priority 0
    thread. This thread commonly also does the gtk interface code, if
    a gtk interface is present. So the startModule, stopModule,
    initialStartModule and finalStopModule methods are called from
    this thread.

    <li> It is common for a module to have one or sometimes more
    activities; the priority for these activities can be freely
    chosen, and is often configurable. So you should take care when
    sharing data between these activities and the module control
    callbacks.

    </ul>

    However, module control callbacks are called with a time
    specification that gives you some lead. In general it is safe to
    access the module's data, and then set the activity active.
