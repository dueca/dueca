                          for later execution) and invoked (=

                          of a function or transport/packing of data
                          etc. Scheduling can be a complex activity,
                          meaning that the actual scheduling takes
                          place only under certain conditions (data
                          from various sources present, n-th time that

/** Activity objects represent a metafor for allocation of
    locus-of-control in DUECA.

    DUECA is a data driven architecture, and many events (usually
    arrival of data, but also the passing of time), can lead to the
    situation where activities need to be performed/invoked. For
    anything to happen, an Activity needs to be created, and it needs
    to be connected to the events that trigger its scheduling. Once
    scheduled, it will be invoked by the ActivityManager. Whether this
    happens at once or later depends on the other Activities
    scheduled, and the importance of a specific Activity.

    You could allocate an Activity by making a class derived from this
    one. However, this is not recommended. Instead, make a Callback
    object and use an ActivityCallback object. */

/** The most common type of activity, one which uses a GenericCallback

    Use objects of this class if you want to "do" something in a DUECA
    process. The common use is to create a Callback object which calls
    back a function in your class, and then create an ActivityCallback
    object that takes the Callback object as an argument. Then, as
    needed, switch the Activity on and off, and supply a
    PeriodicTimeSpec to your own taste.

    In your header
    \code
      Callback<MyClass>     cb;
      ActivityCallback      my_activity;
    \endcode

    In the initialisation list of your constructor:
    \code
      cb(this, &MyClass::OneOfMyFunctions),
      my_activity(getId(), "my activity", &cb, priority_spec),
    \endcode

    Where OneOfMyFunctions has to have the following type:
    \code
      void OneOfMyFunctions(const TimeSpec& ts);
    \endcode

    Commonly used member functions are:
    <ul>
    <li> Activity::switchOn, Activity::switchOff, for controlling the Activity
    <li> TriggerTarget::setTrigger, defines wich events trigger the Activity
    <li> Activity::setTimeSpec, specify periodic invocation
