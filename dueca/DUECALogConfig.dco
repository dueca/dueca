;; Configuration message for DUECA logging.
;;
;; When configured to listen to config messages, the Logger will
;; only start logging after such a message has been received.
;;
;; Possible modes of operation:
;;
;; - Simply configuring the attribute for the default logging; send
;;   one message, with filename and prefix empty, and optionally the
;;   attribute string filled. This uses the default filename supplied
;;   to the logger, and no prefix.
;;
;; - Multiple log files; send a message whenever a new log should be
;;   started, typically in HoldCurrent mode. When the filename is not
;;   empty, a new file is opened using the filename. When the filename
;;   is empty, and also the prefix is empty, a new filename is used
;;   with the default naming pattern.
;;
;; - Multiple logs in a single file (if possible with the logger); if
;;   the filename is empty, and the prefix is non-empty, the current
;;   file is used, and an additional set of logging data is added under
;;   the new prefix. The first message sent in this way may also specify
;;   the filename.

       ;; respectively.
