/** Priority specification. DUECA usually runs with several
    threads. A PrioritySpec defines in which thread an activity will
    run, and how important the activity is relative to other
    activities in that same thread. Priority 0 is the administrative
    priority, this is also the priority that runs any (if present)
    graphics libraries. The highest priority is configurable in the
    dueca.cnf file.

    A PrioritySpec is normally used to specify the priority of a
    module. It can be constructed from scheme with the following call:

    \verbinclude priority-spec.scm

    Where prio is the priority, and thus the selection for a thread,
    and order specifies the relative importance within that
    thread. The higher the order, the more important the activity with
    respect to other activities in the same thread.
