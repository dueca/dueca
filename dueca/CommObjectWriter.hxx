/** Class to access a communication object. Is returned by querying a
    channel, the most common way to get these is by creating a DCOWriter.

    This class implements introspection-based access to DCO
    objects. If you have a void pointer and know the classname, this
    can also be created directly.

    Based on either the name of the data member, or on the index of a
    data member (as returned by the DataClassRegistry::getMemberIndex call)
    you can create an ElementWriter. With such a writer the members of
    the encapsulated object can be manipulated.

    The DCOWriter accesses the data in a channel. These objects

    access to the channel is released again.

    A DCOWriter is an alternative to using a @ref DataWriter. This variant
    is for generic, introspective access, using a DataWriter is much
    more efficient when you can program for the data type.
