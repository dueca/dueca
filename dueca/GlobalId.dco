;; This class defines an ID pair, consisting of a location id, identifying
;; a participating dueca node, and an object id, identifying an
;; object (or channel) created in that node.
;;
;; The ObjectManager maintains a list of references to local objects, indexed
;; on the object id, the ChannelManager does the same for channels.
;;
;; Local and remote queries for an object, defined by its name
;; and the entity in which it participates, are returned with a GlobalId
