/** class that contains the data of a single time point of a single
    entry in a UnifiedChannel.

    The UChannelEntryData is implemented as a doubly-linked list. The
    data is given a writing sequence, starting from 1, keeps a pointer
    to the client data, and keeps the specified time.

    An empty list contains a sentinel UChannelEntryData object. The
    sentinel object holds a valid sequence number (which start from
    1), a null pointer to the data, and a zero for the time. For a
    list with stream data, the sentinel object will contain the
    validity end of the latest written datapoint.

    For event type data, the time simply indicates the validity point
    of the data.

    For stream type data, which has a validity start and a validity
    end, the start is given in the object with the data, and the end
    is given in the next (sentinel) object. If stream writing is
    interrupted, an object with a null pointer for the data, and a zero
    for the sequence, is written, marking the start time of the gap

    Example stream data, with the linked list pointers omitted:

    <table>
    <th><td> time </td><td> data </td><td> seq </td>
    <td> explanation </td></th>

    <tr><td> 10 </td><td> xxx </td><td> 1 </td>
    <td> first point, valid for (10,20) </td></tr>

    <tr><td> 20 </td><td> xxx </td><td> 2 </td>
    <td> second point, contiguous to first, valid for (20,30) </td></tr>

    <tr><td> 30 </td><td> yyy </td><td> 3 </td>
    <td> third point, etcetera. </td></tr>

    <tr><td> 40 </td><td> NULL </td><td> 0 </td>
    <td> the gap starts here, at 40 </td></tr>

    <tr><td> 240 </td><td> zzz </td><td> 4 </td>
    <td> new data, (240,250) </td></tr>

    <tr><td> 250 </td><td> NULL </td><td> 5 </td>
    <td> currently sentinel, marks end of pt 4 range </td></tr>
    </table>

    As data is added, a new sentinel is written, the current
    sentinel's NULL pointer is replaced, and the UChannelEntry's
    latest pointer is updated.

    In addition each UChannelEntryData object holds a counter with
    (1+the current number of accesses). This counter is atomically
    incremented or decremented, if necessary in a lock-free
    manner. When >1, the data point cannot be cleaned away.

    If a channel has one or more sequential reading clients, the
    oldest datapoint's read_accesses counter is increase with the
    number of sequential reading clients. As these clients read, they
    will decrement the oldest datapoint's read_accesses counter and
    increment the one of the following datapoint.

      Normally the end time is written, and for stream data, the span
      is defined by the end time of the previous point.  If a stream

      has no data. Event data has only a single time point defined, in
      that case this tick contains that time point.
