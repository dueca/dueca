/** This is a media accessor based on a common memory principle. This
    accessor uses SCRAMNet shared memory to communicate between
    several computers.

    A ScramNetAccessor is not normally called from a user program. Use
    the scheme construction capabilities to create it as follows:
    \code
    (dueca-list
     (make-scramnet-accessor
      no-of-nodes this-node-id ; no parties, my id
      "scram"                  ; name for the area
      1                        ; only used on QNX, Scramnet ID
      (* 1024 1024)            ; area size, 1M
      8000                     ; each block
      pkt                      ; packer
      upkt                     ; unpacker
      (make-time-spec 0 40)    ; time spec watcher
