DUECA_NS_START

/** Time warp for a triggering device. Say that you want to calculate
    your turbulence/wind field or whatever property that does not rely
    on input ahead of time. You could trigger on the ticker with a
    time warp:

    \code
    // make a 'permanent' time warp (element of your class, or with
    // 'new'
    TimeWarp* tw = new TimeWarp(Ticker::single(), 20);
    my_activity.setTrigger(*tw);
    \endcode

    Now at -- say -- step 100-101, your activity gets triggered for
    120-121, for a logical time that comes later (in the future) than
    the actual time of triggering. For negative warps the thing works
    the other way around.

    Be careful when doing this with channels. If you timewarp into the
    (logical) future, the channel will not yet be filled with data
    from the time span you are referring to, and if you warp too much
    into the past, a stream channel may have run out of data.
