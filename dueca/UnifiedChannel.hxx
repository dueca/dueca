/* Design considerations:

 - A UnifiedChannel can hold multiple "entries" of different data
   types. Each entry is created when a write token is instantiated.

 - The entries vector holds pointers to the different entries. The
   vector is indexed by EntryHandle, an unsigned int (currently 2 bytes)

 - The entrymap map maintains a cross index between the data class and
   the entries. An entry may occur multiple times in the entrymap, if
   its datatype is inherited, once for the basic data type and once
   for each parent of that datatype. The entrymap accesses linked
   lists with pointers to the entries.

 - Any client, associated with a read token, holds a pointer to a linked
   list from the entrymap. This copy provides access to the same entry
   objects that the channel uses.

 - A version system is used to keep clients and the channel in sync.
   Whenever an entry is added or deleted, a version counter in the
   channel is updated. Each client has a version counter as well,
   when data access is attempted, the version counters are compared. When
   the channel version counter is ahead, the client's information must
   be updated. This action is safeguarded by a lock.

 - Client information is assembled in an UCClientHandle object.

 - The config_version counter is also reflected in the UChannelEntry
   objects when a UCCLientHandle object is updated, the version
   counter is used to determine whether any update wrt this entry is
   needed. The version counter is also updated when the entry is to be
   decommissioned.

/** A "Channel" is the primary means of communication in a DUECA
    process. Older versions of DUECA provided different types of
    channels, for different types of data;

    <ul>
    <li> "Event" channels that provide event data; data are
    associated with a single point in time, and where one time point
    may have zero, one or more events.</li>

    <li>"Stream" channels, that provide data with a continuous
    validity. Each data point is associated with a certain time
    interval (valid from, valid until), and the time intervals are in
    principle contiguous. Old Stream channels provided a single set of
    data per channel.</li>

    <li>"MultiStream" channels, which also provide data with a
    continuous validity, but can contain multiple entries per
    channel. All entries are of the same class (data type) and have
    time properties as the stream channel listed above. </li>
    </ul>

    The UnifiedChannel objects replace all above variants, and offer
    wider possiblities.  This is a versatile channel that may contain
    multiple entries, which per entry may differ in data type. You may
    compare this with the HLA-style publish-subscribe mechanism,
    including capability for inheritance but without "data
    management". In contrast to HLA, the data and entries are held and
    organised in the channel itself, relieving the user of a
    considerable amount of bookkeeping. In addition, the
    UnifiedChannel is pervaded with DUECA's notions of time and
    time-tagging, and integrated with the triggering and scheduling
    system, making real-time and consistent simulation a breeze.

    This class builds forth on the GenericChannel class. It adds the
    functionality needed for reading and writing data on a channel
    with multiple "entries" or "personalities" in it. For example it
    may be used to transmit entity-to-entity data from all aircraft in
    a simulation.

    To get read or write access to the channel, components need to
    create a ChannelReadToken or a ChannelWriteToken. The
    local copy of the channel (this class) is then created if it did
    not previously exist. Each ChannelWriteToken creates an entry
    in the channel, and this entry will be replicated on any channel
    ends on other nodes. With the destruction of the
    ChannelWriteToken the entry disappears again.

    Updating of the entries held by a module is done by producing a
    DataWriter on the ChannelWriteToken. Reading is done by producing
    a DataReader on the ChannelReadToken.

    Depending on the options used to create the ChannelReadToken, the
    token may have methods to cycle to the first entry of the
    appropriate data type in the channel and walk through all matching
    (meaning of the same data type) entries until the last entry has
    been read. Alternatively, the read token may be linked to a single
    entry.

    When set-up to access only a single entry in the channel, the
    ChannelReadToken can function as a trigger for activity. Another
    possible use of this channel is driving your simulation off other
    data streams (e.g. your own aircraft's input) and reading the
    latest out of the channel (which the ChannelReadToken and
    ChannelReader do by default). You can also supply classes such as
    an Extrapolator (as a template class of your own design) to the
    ChannelReader, and extrapolate the data.

    Finally, the ChannelWriteToken or ChannelReadToken may be equipped
    with a callback that is activated when the corresponding entry
    becomes valid, and the token is validated.
