/** Base class for monitoring a channel.

    To monitor the creation and deletion of entries in a channel,
    either derive from this class and reimplement the
    ChannelWatcher::entryAdded and ChannelWatcher::entryRemoved
    methods, or select polling mode and regularly call the checkChange
    function.

    Note that you have to be careful about threading issues. The
    callbacks are performed in the prio 0 thread, if your module
    performs other activities in other threads, make sure that use of
    your module's data is done in a thread-safe manner (either use
    StateGuard to implement mutex functionality, use AsyncList for
    single-producer, single-consumer thread-safe communication, or use
    atomic variables).

    Another alternative is polling the ChannelWatcher. It is safe to
    call the checkChange function from any thread.
