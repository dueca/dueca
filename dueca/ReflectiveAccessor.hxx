/** ReflectiveAccessor is a media accessors based on some shared
    memory mechanism.

    This uses a shared memory area, e.g. implemented in SCRAMNet
    reflective memory, to communicate between DUECA nodes. The memory
    is set-up as follows, here "no_parties" is the number of nodes in
    the communication.

    <ol>

    <li> no_parties (4 byte) words, one for each participant in the
         communication. These words are used at initialisation of the
         communication, and after initialisation, for writing tick
         counters, which are then used to check all nodes are alive,
         and for synchronisation. Tick counters are written at the
         compatible-tick rate.

    <li> no_parties areas, each of size commbuf_size + no_parties + 1
         (in words), each area starts with a control buffer of
         no_parties words, a node identification with the dueca node
         id, 1 word, and then a communication buffer of commbuf_size
         words, which will be used as a circular buffer.
    </ol> */
