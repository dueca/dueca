/** A TimingCheck object monitors the timing of a certain
    Activity. Start of the activity invocation and the end of the
    invocation is compared to the "real" time in a node, and an
    average, minimum and maximum count is recorded, as well as the
    number of delays beyond a warning limit and beyond a critical
    limit.

    A TimingCheck can be added to an Activity by creating one
    with the activity as an argument. Results from the check are
    assembled and sent over a channel, and made accessible by the
    (single) TimingView object that exists in a DUECA process.

    The most flexible method is adding a TimingCheck option to the
    configuration of your module. In the ParameterTable add:

    \code
      { "check-timing",
         new MemberCall<SpacePlane,vector<int> >
        (&SpacePlane::checkTiming)},
    \endcode

    Add the new call to your class declaration, and add the following
    implementation:

    \code
    bool SpacePlane::checkTiming(const vector<int>& i)
    {
      if (i.size() == 3) {
        new TimingCheck(do_step, i[0], i[1], i[2]);
      }
      else if (i.size() == 2) {
        new TimingCheck(do_step, i[0], i[1]);
      }
      else {
        return false;
      }
      return true;
    }
    \endcode

    This code will be generated automatically if you use the
    "newModule" script to generate a framework for a module.
