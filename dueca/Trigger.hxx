/** Base class for all objects that can set activities into motion.

    Several objects in DUECA are derived from this class, e.g. channel
    read tokens, and various alarm types (PeriodicAlarm,
    AperiodicAlarm).

    Using derivatives of the TriggerPuller class, and derivatives of
    its companion, the TriggerTarget, application programmers can
    flexibly specify triggering conditions. The triggering commonly
    ends up at the ActivityCallback class. When triggering conditions
    produce a valid activation, the ActivityCallback class is
    scheduled with its associated ActivityManager, and the callback
    subsequently executed.

    This class is not normally used directly for application
    programming. The typical approach is to take TriggerTargets
    (normally the ActivityCallback), and use alarms or channel read
    tokens as triggers for these targets with the setTrigger() call.

    Optionally, more complex triggering conditions can be obtained by
    using a ConditionAnd or ConditionOr object to combine triggering
    activations.

/** "And" combination of different TriggerPullers.

    Note that you need not make an AND combination directly, it is

    Example:

    @code
    my_activity.setTrigger(tokena && tokenb);
    @endcode

    This creates a ref-counted ConditionAnd on the fly, and sets it as
    the activity's trigger.

    A ConditionAnd will look for overlapping time intervals in the
    combined triggers; if tokenA triggers for (10,20), (20,30) and
    tokenB triggers for (8,12),(12,16), etc., the resulting trigger
    timing will be (10,12) (12,16), ...

    Take care that both tokens are triggering approximately
    simultaneously; if tokenA is not triggering, all the triggering
    information in tokenB needs to be stored, leading to increased
    memory use.

    When used in conjunction with a channel with event data, a
    monotonically increasing event-type triggering comes out. So if
    tokenB has (14,14), (27,27), (35,35); still with the triggering on
    tokenA as given above, the resulting trigger will be (14,14),
    (27,27), and the (35,35) comes out when tokenA has progressed to
    or beyond that point. I foresee no sensible scenario where this
    may be useful.
