/** Access token for writing an entry in a UnifiedChannel.

    A UnifiedChannel is a channel that can contain multiple entries,
    of different data types. Older versions of DUECA had stream
    channels, for periodically updated data, or event channels, for
    point events. This channel holds both data types. It can also
    hold multiple "entries", and each entry may be of a different data
    class.

    Different types of data may be written in the channel, and
    multiple entries may be present. For reading one supplies the data
    type (class) that one wants to read.

    To get read or write access to the channel, components need to
    create a ChannelReadToken or a ChannelWriteToken.

    This class defines the ChannelWriteToken. After creating a
    ChannelWriteToken, a local copy of the channel is created if it
    did not previously exist. Each ChannelWriteToken creates an entry
    in the channel, and this entry will be replicated on any channel
    ends on other nodes. With the destruction of the ChannelWriteToken
    the entry disappears again.

    Each entry has an entry id, but that is valid only for its
    lifetime; entry id's may be recycled, and it is not possibly to
    "specify" an entry id.

    Updating of the entries held by a module is done by producing a
    DataWriter on the ChannelWriteToken, and using this DataWriter to
    manipulate the data. Data types are created from .dco files by
    DUECA's code generator. Any members of a data type that are not
    changed through the DataWriter will be equal to the data from the
    previous time step. Reading is done by producing a DataReader
    on a ChannelReadToken.

    As an alternative, the ChannelWriteToken or ChannelReadToken can
    be read in a generic, type-agnostic manner by creating a
    CommObjectWriter respectively a CommObjectReader, and using that
    object to traverse the data. Note that reading/writing of a
    channel in that manner incurs significant overhead.

  /** Constructor, creates a token to write data in the channel, and
      if needed it creates the associated channel end.
      @param owner         Identification of the owner.
      @param channelname   Name of the channel end, for the connecting
                           publish-subscribe mechanism.
      @param dataclassname Name of the data type to be written. This must
                           match an existing DUECA %Channel Object (DCO) type.
      @param entrylabel    Fixed identifying label to be given to this entry.
      @param time_aspect   The data in the entry may represent a continuous
                           time approximation (EntryTimeAspect::Continuous,
                           "stream") data, which has a contiguous time
                           span associated with it, or it
                           may represent individual data items
                           (EntryTimeAspect::Events, "event"),
                           which are marked with a time point.
      @param arity         If OnlyOneEntry, the channel is limited to one
                           entry only. If another entry is already present,
                           the token will not become valid. If
                           OneOrMoreEntries, multiple entries may be written
                           to the channel.
      @param packmode      Indicate whether differential packing should be
                           used or the default full packing is
                           used. Differential packing packs only the
                           difference with respect to the previous
                           data point.
      @param tclass        Transportation priority for the channel. Must match
                           the priority specified by other write tokens.
      @param when_valid    Optional callback, to be invoked when the token
                           becomes valid. You can use a GenericCallback pointer
                           here, or an AcitivityCallback pointer.

                           support for user code!
