/** Access token used to read data from a UnifiedChannel.

    A UnifiedChannel is a channel that can contain multiple
    entries. Each entry can have a different data type(class). This
    ChannelReadToken gives access to one of the data types in a
    UnifiedChannel. At construction of the access token one can
    specify that the token can iterate over all entries of that data
    type in the channel, or that the token is limited to a single
    entry. See the dueca::ChannelWriteToken for information on writing
    entries in a channel.

    Note that in many cases, a channel has only one entry. This of
    course simplifies handling the channel. It is possible to read all
    entries matching a specify data type. Only in that case it is
    necessary to use the ChannelReadToken::selectFirstEntry(),
    ChannelReadToken::selectFirstEntry() and
    ChannelReadToken::haveEntry() calls. For channels with multiple
    entries (e.g., to read all the traffic in a simulation), it is
    more efficient, both computationally and from the view of the
    programmer, to use a ChannelWatcher to detect changes in the
    channel, and add ChannelReadToken(s) that read just specific
    entries.

    Older versions of DUECA had stream channels, for periodically
    updated data, where the data is valid for a specific time span, or
    event channels, representing events happening at specific
    times. Present versions of DUECA have a single channel type,
    dueca::UnifiedChannel. This channel holds both data variants, and
    replaces both old channel types. Compatibility with older dueca is
    maintained, with the UnifiedChannel objects implementing the
    functionality of the previous channels. See
    dueca::EventAccessToken, dueca::StreamAccessToken,
    dueca::MultiStreamReadToken, dueca::EventWriteToken,
    dueca::StreamWriteToken and dueca::MultiStreamWriteToken if you
    find old code still using this.

    Either a specific entry, identified by its entry ID, or by label,
    is selected when the token is created. To select only a specific
    entry, use the Channel::OnlyOneEntry specification. In this case
    the channel may still have multiple entries, but access is to a
    single specific entry. Alternatively, with
    Channel::OneOrMoreEntries or Channel::ZeroOrMoreEntries, the token
    can be used to traverse all entries of the given data class. Note
    that the entry multiplicity is defined slightly differently for a
    *write* token; there OnlyOneEntry means that a channel will be
    restricted to only that single entry.

    The data class can display inheritance. You may compare this with
    the HLA-style publish-subscribe mechanism, without the data
    management. The interface is drastically different from HLA
    implementation, in the sense that data is internally kept and
    managed by the channel, and easy reading and writing is provided.

    When creating a dueca::ChannelReadToken or a
    dueca::ChannelWriteToken, a local copy of the channel (a "channel
    end") is created in a node if it did not previously exist.

    To declare a ChannelReadToken:
    \code
    ChannelReadToken         r_mytoken;
    \endcode

    To initialize it, typically in a class constructor list:

    \code
    r_mytoken(this->getId(), NameSet("MyDataClass://myentity/channelname"),
              "MyDataClass"),
    \endcode

    In this case, an entry number is not selected and by default only
    the first (0) entry is selected. This entry must match the data
    type, otherwise the token will not become valid.  This entry must
    have data of class MyDataClass, or data of a class that derives
    from MyDataClass. Note that, by convention, the class part of the
    channel name is often also set to "MyDataClass", but that this is
    not strictly necessary; another name could be chosen there. The
    defaults are to treat the data in the channel as stream data; data
    defined for contiguous time intervals.

    A default time span of 0.2 seconds is supplied, meaning that data
    is kept available for at least a 0.2 second time span. When reading,
    the data corresponding to the specified time is looked up and returned.

    Here is another example:
    \code
    r_mytoken(this->getId(), NameSet("MyDataClass://myentity/channelname"),
              "MyDataClass", 0, Channel::Events, Channel::ReadAllData),
    \endcode

    In this case, only entry 0 (the first) is selected. The data class
    must match that entry's data class for the token to become
    valid. Requested reading mode is ReadAllData, meaning that data
    will be discarded only after it has been accessed by this
    token. Note that this carries an obligation to access and read all
    data; otherwise the channel clogs up, leading to error messages
    and forced discarding of data. The time access is now
    Channel::Events. %Event data is tagged with a single time point
    only, and multiple data sets may be tagged with the same
    time. There may also be times that there is no (new) data.

    Before using the token for further access, it needs to be checked
    for validity. You can repeat this check if the first check does
    not succeed.

    \code
    bool v = r_mytoken.isValid();
    \endcode

    Note that this check is commonly done in the Module::isPrepared()
    call. It is so common, that a macro has been defined, e.g.:

    \code
    bool res = true;
    CHECK_TOKEN(r_mytoken);
    \endcode

    A token may also be used as a trigger. Note that in some cases
    this does not make sense; if you have multiple stream entries in a
    channel, the triggering may become erratic (repeating itself) as
    the different entries are updated with data for new times. The
    most sensible cases for triggering are channels with stream data
    with one entry only, or event channels. You can also create a
    token that focuses on one entry in a channel with multiple
    entries, and trigger on that single entry.

    If you need to, and selected multiple entries when creating the
    token, a typical reading application for multiple entries might
    do:

    \code
    // for when all entries have read all the entries
    for (my_token.selectFirstEntry(); my_token.haveEntry();
         my_token.selectNextEntry()) {

      // use a DataReader to access the data from the currently
      // selected entry in the channel
      DataReader<MyDataClass> r(my_token, ts);

      // read, by accessing the MyDataClass object with r.data()

      // closing off this block, so reader is destroyed and read
      // access is released.
    }
    \endcode

    Note that the order in which the entries appear does not need to
    be the order in which the write tokens were made.

    A more rapid option for reading the data from channels with multiple
    entries is by using a dueca::ChannelWatcher . The %ChannelWatcher
    monitors creation and deletion of entries in a channel, and upon
    creation of an entry you can create a read token specifically for
    that entry.

    Check the different dueca::DataReader template specializations to
    see the different types of accessing data.

    If you specified the entry ID at token creation, you cannot recurse
    over the entries in the channel. On the other hand in that case you
    can use the token as a trigger for activities. The associated
    activity will be scheduled when data arrives for the specified entry.
