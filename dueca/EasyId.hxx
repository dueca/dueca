DUECA_NS_START

/** Internally in DUECA, some objects need an id, but cannot derive
    from NamedObject, because they could be initialized automatically
    before the ObjectManager. A pointer to an EasyId can then be used,
    and the EsyId is instantiated later.

    In some cases, having a class that derives from EasyId can be
    useful in application code. Only do this when you have an object
    that is not a Module, and also not associated with a (single)
    Module, but that still needs some Module-like capabilities, such
    as accessing a channel.

    When having classes that are clearly associated with a
    dueca::Module (helper classes to handle a specific channel entry
    or the like), instead use dueca::AssociateObject, which can
    "borrow" access to the Module's name and identity.
