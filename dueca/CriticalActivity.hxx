class Module;

/** This is an activity that uses one of \em two GenericCallback objects
    to allow your module to do something. The primary activity is
    useful in the simulation, the secondary activity is necessary for
    safety. Use this if you have to control a device.

    Use objects of this class if you want to "do" something in a DUECA
    process. The common use is to create Callback objects which call
    back functions in your class, and then create a CriticalActivity
    object that takes the Callback objects as an argument. Then, as
    needed, switch the Activity on and off, and supply a
    PeriodicTimeSpec to your own taste.

    In your header
    \code
      Callback<MyClass>     cbwork, cbsafe;
      CriticalActivity      my_activity;
    \endcode

    In the initialisation list of your constructor:
    \code
      cbwork(this, &MyClass::OneOfMyFunctions),
      cbsafe(this, &MyClass::AnotherOfMyFunctions),
      my_activity(this, "my activity", &cbwork, &cbsafe, priority_spec),
    \endcode

    Where OneOfMyFunctions has to have the following type:
    \code
      void OneOfMyFunctions(const TimeSpec& ts);
    \endcode

    Commonly used member functions are:
    <ul>
    <li> Activity::switchOn, Activity::switchOff, for controlling the
         Activity
    <li> CriticalActivity::switchWork, CriticalActivity::switchSafe for
         controlling the mode.
    <li> TriggerTarget::setTrigger, defines wich events trigger the Activity
    <li> Activity::setTimeSpec, specify periodic invocation
    </ul> */
