/** This class is a common base to all objects with a name. These
    objects will be locatable by the CSE registry.

    The name consists of a tuple (entity, cclass, part)

    <ul>
    <li> entity is the simulated entity, e.g. "PH-LAB"
    <li> cclass is the model class of the channel or component,
    e.g. "engine signals"
    <li> part is the part within the entity, e.g. "engine 1"
    </ul>

    The NamedObject class links the name tuple to an object id. The
    object id consists of another tuple (location, object).

    <ul>
    <li> location is the DUECA node where an object is located.
    <li> object is an id of the object itself.
    </ul>

    Note that the entity, class, part tuple is stored, upon creation,
    in the registry. The methods that query this tuple use the
    registry, in combination with my_id, to return the answer.

    The registry will provide methods to obtain the object id from the
    (entity, class, part) tuple and vice versa.  */
