/** This is a triggering device that can provide your activity with
    user-controlled, a-periodic triggering. Create an a-periodic
    alarm, e.g. as one  of the objects in your module class, and
    request to be triggered at some time.

    Triggering will take place at the clock time specified for the
    alarm, or with the next available clock tick if that time has
    already passed. */

      not. The only reason for failure of implementation of an alarm
      is that the time requested is smaller (earlier) than a time
      requested earlier. In other words, alarms only stack up at the

      a record of the triggering time, which is updated with the time
      you feed to the requestAlarm(TimeTickType time) call, or, when
      you use this call, it is incremented by one.

      If you only use this alarm, you get triggers at 0, 1, 2
      etc. However, an activity only runs when it is switched on. If
      you switch on your activity later, it usually gets a switch-on
      time in the thousands, and all these initial triggers are
      lost. To prevent this, in this case switch on your activity from
      the "beginning of time",
      \code
      my_activity.switchOn(0);
