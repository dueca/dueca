/** \page rtw Including code from Simulink (old, until Matlab 2012b)

Many computer-aided control engineering packages have an option to
export a model to C or C++ code. Often this option is used to solve a
calculation-intensive problem in a quicker way, because the exported
model does not suffer from the overhead from the package, but this
code can also be ported to other environments. DUECA currently offers
the possibility to include Simulink models converted with Real-Time
Workshop.

Here is an older description is based on Matlab 2012b, with Simulink
8.3.  When in your model, select "Simulation" - "Model Configuration
Parameters", then change the following options:

<ol>

<li> Under "Solver", select "Fixed-step", and "ode4". Set the proper
step size and select "SingleTasking" for the tasking mode.

<li> Under "Optimization", "Signals and Parameters", if you uncheck
the "inline Parameters" flag, you can modify the parameters of the
built code, otherwise these are fixed.

<li> To ensure better compatibility, when your target platform is (as
in most cases) a 64 bit Intel compatible, under "Hardware
Implementation", select Intel for the vendor, and x86-64 for the
device type.

<li> Model Referencing, as far as I can determine, does not work for
R2012b code generation with our options, so include any sub models in
your present model.

<li> Under "Code generation", select "grt_malloc.tlc" (the generic
one, not the one for Visual C++) as your system target file. You can
uncheck the "Generate makefile" flag. For the code generation, select
either the debugging or execution efficiency objective. Finally select
the "Fenerate code only" flag.

<li> Under "Code generation" / "Interface", uncheck MAT-file logging.

</ol>

The script new-module offers the possibility to prepare a file for
inclusion of a Real-Time Workshop generated model. Check with
"new-module", without arguments, to see which versions are currently
available.



\section simulink_versions Different versions of real-time workshop code

One thing you need to be aware of is that all RTW code you put into a
dueca executable must have the same version. When using RTW code, you
should edit the main Makefile (the one in the "application directory")
and specify that you are going to use one of the rtw modules with the
DCOMPONENTS variables.

\section simulink_call Calling Simulink/RTW code version 3

Generate a skeleton for your module by invoking the new-module script:
\code
new-module rtw??   <fill in the rtw version here>
\endcode

The step size of the model can be adjusted. This code is added by
default to the setTimeSpec model. Note that some generated models
don't function well when the time step is changed, so I recommend
generating the model with the proper step size, and not messing with
this.

For calculation of the model response, you first need to set the input
vector values. Look in in doCalculation for the template code.
\skip copy
\until ssGetU

\section xml_import Communicating state and parameters between MATLAB/Simulink and DUECA
As from RTWv5.0 and up, DUECA includes the option to generate xml parser
scripts that you can use to communicate states and model parameters
between DUECA and simulink. When invoking
\code
new-module rtw[x]
\endcode
You are prompted if you want this functionality. \see XmlSnapshot

Note that you need to select the C interfacing option in the real-time
workshop code generation for this; the parameters of your model will
then be accessible to the DUECA code.

\section simulink_sense Making sense of what the Simulink code produces

Of course, you do this Simulink stuff for some purpose. The rest of
your simulation needs to know what it can do with the output of the
Simulink code. My advice is to write a file that defines the states
and outputs of the Simulink model with enumerated types. Here is a
piece of my StatesOutputs.hxx file:

\dontinclude StatesOutputs.hxx
\skip output_vec
\until gamma

Using these enumerated values it is easy to see what type of output you
are looking at. There is a check possible on (at least) the number of
outputs in the Simulink model and the ones listed in your
StatesOutputs.hxx file. As last output (state), define:
\skip gamma_c
\until }

The value of Y_no_outputs is equal to the number of outputs in the
Simulink model, given by the define "OUTPUTS" in the include file of
your model. Use this to check the sanity of your code.

\section simulink_callfour Calling Simulink/RTW code version 4

Generate a skeleton for your module by invoking the new-module script:
\code
new-module rtw4
\endcode

So, with the advent of Matlab 6.5, also the real-time workshop got a
work-over. This makes things so much harder again. The code generated
by the new-module script is more or less comparable to the previous
code, with frequent substitutions of "ss" to "rtw" or something
similar.

\section simulink_whatfiles What files to keep and include in your project?

Simulink generates a large number of files. Some of these are common to all models, and have been included in the rtw libraries packed with dueca. What files do you keep, and what do you throw away?

Suppose you created a model called MyModel. When generating the code with above options, Simulink creates a directory MyModel_grt_malloc_rtw. From that directory, keep:

<ol>
<li>MyModel.c
<li>MyModel.c
<li>MyModel_private.h
<li>MyModel_types.h
<li>rtmodel.h
<li>rtwtypes.h
</ol>

Simulink also generated defines.txt and modelsource.txt. Keep these
for reference. If you can, also store the model file (MyModel.slx),
any sub-models you might have included alongside the code (i.e., on
the repository), and the Matlab file that contains the initial
parameters (and state?) for your model, e.g., MyModel_init.m.

If you initialise the parameters and state of the model before doing
the code generation, these parameters and state will be built into
your model.
