/** \page primarycontrols_code Code generated by the code generator

Here is, as an example the header file for the PrimaryControls object,
as it is generated by the code generator for DUECA:

The body with implementation looks like:

\verbinclude PrimaryControls.cxx

All this code is generated from a compact representation in the
PrimaryControls.dco file:

\verbinclude PrimaryControls.dco
