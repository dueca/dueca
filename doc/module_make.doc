/** \page module_make Makefile for module

Here is the template Makefile for creating a module:

\include Makefile.mod

A few things (might) have to be adjusted:

<ul>
<li> You might use additional libraries in your simulation. In that
case, specify the headers here:
\skip needed
\until EXTRA_INCLUDES

<li> Normally, all .cxx files are compiled and included in your module
code. Change the following line if you need to select only some:
\skip c++-files
\until CPPSRC

<li> Likewise for .c files:
\skip c-files
\until CSRC


<li> You can also make local additions to this makefile:
\skip SECTION
\until local-mrproper
</ul>

Note that, aside from the includes line, it is normally not necessary
to edit this makefile.
