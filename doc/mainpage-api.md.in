## Introduction {#main_intro}


DUECA (Delft University Environment for Communication and Activation)
is a framework for the implementation of (real-time) programs. This
framework is written in C++, so if you want to make programs for
DUECA, you will have to program in C++ too. A framework also means
that you will have to write your programs in a certain style. Of
course, restricting yourself to using a framework seems foolish if you
don't get anything back in turn. But if you stick to the framework,
DUECA, can offer you some advantages that might make it worthwile to
use DUECA.

The DUECA framework offers four important advantages (services):
<ol>

<li> Communication. DUECA can transport your data for you. As long as
you are using a single computer on which you run your program, this
might not seem important, but if you have a program that is split over
several computers (such as a simulation), this becomes a big
advantage. By sticking to DUECA's rules for communication, the pieces
of your program will be able to communicate, whether they are running
on a single computer or distributed over a network. DUECA not only
distributes your data, but time-tags all data and keeps the data
history in a small buffer, enabling robust and deterministic
simulations (each run, given the same inputs, produces the same
outputs).

<li> Activation. In a real-time program, you often have a task that
has to be carried out regularly, with a certain \em update \em
rate. Or you have tasks that have to run in response to certain
events. In conventional frameworks for real-time programs (which DUECA
is not), you would have to add a call to your routine somewhere in a
"main loop", at an appropriate update rate. In DUECA you simply
specify the update rate that your task needs, and what data should be
available when your task runs. The schedule is created automatically
and dynamically. A viewer is available to inspect the result, and
aggregate data such as average, minimum and maximum activation and
completion time can be logged.

<li> Creation. In DUECA you can make pieces of program that are called
"modules". An example of a module could be the engine simulation for
an aircraft, but you can also put your whole aircraft simulation into
one big module. As you start up DUECA, a script file is read. This
script file describes how your simulation is built up from different
modules. As long as modules communicate in the same way, with DUECA's
mechanisms, you can swap one module for another, for example you could
swap a "joystick" module you use on a PC for the "control-loading"
module you would use in a flight simulator.

There are two important advantages in the use of a script file for the
"creation" of a simulation, one is that, once you have a library of
modules, you can easily create a simulation out of what you have
(display, stick, fms, etc.) and a few new modules you make. The other
advantage is that you can transport simulations easily from one
environment (or simulator) to the other, by just swapping the modules
that do the input and output to all hardware devices. You will find
that the most frequent transition will be back and forth from the desk
where you do your development work to the simulator where the final
product is deployed. This transition is facilitated by using a
software repository and DUECA's configuration capabilities.

<li> Configuration. As mentioned, a simulation in DUECA can run on a
single computer, or on a number of computers connected in a
network. In the latter case, one DUECA program, called a \em node,
runs in each of the computers. In each node, the local DUECA program
reads a configuration file that provides the necessary information to
start up on the node, and tells DUECA how to connect to all the other
nodes in the DUECA network. The information in the creation script, as
discussed in the previous point, is distributed when all nodes are
connected.

Typically, each environment where you run will get its own
configuration. In a DUECA project, there is support for maintaining
the configurations for different environments. A standard
configuration, labeled "solo/solo" is typically used for the
development on a single desktop, this configuration will be created
when you start a new DUECA project. Having these configurations helps
you to seamlessly switch back and forth between your desktop
development environment and a simulator or hardware where the final
project is deployed.

</ol>

In more technical terms, DUECA is a middleware environment for the
implementation of processes characterized by a data-flow architecture
on a distributed computing network. DUECA provides tools to run such
processes in real-time.

This documentation is there to help you write applications in
DUECA. It contains descriptions of all the classes needed to interface
with DUECA, and some tutorial material.

## DUSIME {#intro_dusime}

DUSIME (Delft University SIMulation Environment), is a
simulation-specific extension implemented on top of DUECA. DUSIME
extends the basic capabilities of DUECA (Communication, Activation,
Creation and Configuration), and provides basic simulation services
with these. DUSIME gives you the infrastructure to make a simulation
that can stop, start, take snapshots of the model state, re-initialise
to a pre-defined model state (and maybe in some future version
calculate trim conditions for the model). There are also facilities
for recording the user input of a simulation, and replaying that
input. This manual is written for people who use DUECA with DUSIME,
and all the examples concern simulation models.

## Overview of the documentation {#overview}

This documentation has been set up to help you get started in
programming and using DUSIME modules as quickly as possible. It is
really necessary to use a hypertext version of this documentation (so
html or acrobat). The first step you take is to take a look at how to
set up your application, and then you can plunge into the deep with
the quickstart manual. The quick start contains numerous links to
concepts and theory you need as you implement a module. Follow these
if you feel that you need them, and use the "back" button on your
browser to get back to the line of argument in the quick start
section.

Then go on with building an executable and configuring your
simulation.
