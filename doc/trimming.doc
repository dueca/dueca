\subsection trim_intro Trimming your aircraft, calculating initial conditions

One of the nice things about a simulation is that you can start it
from any imaginable situation. When fed with the appropriate data,
the aircraft or other thing that you simulate may start on the runway,
with its engines running, on the platform, with all systems switched
off, or in mid-air, cruising or in the final phase of a landing. The
data that describes such a starting point is the state of the model at
that point. This state is called the "initial condition". Finding an
initial condition that gives a smooth transition from the frozen
simulation to the running simulation is the subject of this section.
