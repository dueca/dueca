Running DUECA on Mac OSX

\section macosx_intro Introduction

DUECA is a middleware environment for real-time distributed
calculation. DUECA has been developed since 1998, been taken in
production in 1999, used in the SIMONA Research Simulator since
2001. DUECA development was initially targeted at Linux and QNX
Neutrino, the operating systems used in running the SRS and various
other labs and facilities at Control and Simulation. Since 2014 a
version for MAC OS X has become available. Early experience shows that
his version runs fine, but in terms of real-time performance is no
match for running DUECA on Linux with even a standard kernel, and
certainly no match for running it on a Linux with a PREEMPT_RT patched
kernel. Thus this DUECA version is targeted at development and
demonstration purposes, for running a lab it is really recommended to
run under Linux.
