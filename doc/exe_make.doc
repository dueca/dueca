/** \page exe_make Makefile for executable

Here is the template Makefile for creating an executable:

\include Makefile.app

A few things (might) have to be adjusted:

<ul>
<li> The pieces of DUECA that you are going to use:
\skip possible
\until DCOMPONENTS

These are options fed to the dueca-config script. Check dueca-config
to see what options are possible.

<li> Any additional libraries (outside the standard DUECA libraries),
that you might have used in your simulation.
\skip specify
\until EXTRALIBS

<li> Occasionally, you need to specify libraries to be loaded after
the dueca libraries:
\skip second
\until EXTRALIBS2

</ul>

This makefile has been kept short, and all generic magic is kept in a
file installed with DUECA.
