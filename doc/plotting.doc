/** @page plotting Plotting with WebSocket connection

    Since 2020, DUECA has a module for WebSocket connections,
    dueca::websock::WebSocketsServer. This module may be used for
    channel data communication between DUECA and web applications, or
    other applications, for example by using the Python WebSockets
    libraries. Communication is through JSON encoded messages, with
    information exchange in the very first message on the structure and
    type of the data.

    An additional use of this module is to generate live plots from
    your DUECA channel data. To this end, a web application is
    available that can be served by the same WebSocket module. The web
    application enables you to have a view of your data from a
    connected web browser, configure plots that use your data, and
    show these plots in your browser. Since normally you would want to
    have the same set of plots for a certain experiment or simulation,
    you can also store the data connection and plot configuration in a
    file, for later re-loading.

    The application is still a bit rough around the edges, any
    suggestions for improvement will be welcomed.

    @section plotting_setup Setting up the data communication

    To receive channel information over a WebSocket connection, you
    need to enable the websocket module (--websock to the DCOMPONENTS
    variable in the main Makefile), and configure which channels need
    to be exported. The example given here is with python:

    @code{.py}
        mymods.append(
           dueca.Module(
               "web-sockets-server", "", admin_priority).param(
                   ('info', ("mydata", "MyData://PHLAB")),
                   ('write-and-read', ("plotconfig",
                                       "ConfigFileRequest://dueca",
                                       "ConfigFileData://dueca")),
                   ('http-port', 8000),
                   ('document-root', '/usr/share/dplotter/dist')))
    @endcode

    The 'info' configurations define endpoints that contain your
    available channels. The 'write-and-read' endpoint is for storing
    and retrieving configuration files. A module in the "dueca" entity
    handles these file actions, add that to the DUECA_mods variable:

    @code{.py}
        DUECA_mods.append(dueca.Module("config-storage", "", admin_priority))
    @endcode

    With this, you can start up a browser, and connect to a running DUECA process, on port 8000. That will open a page with four tabs;

    * Info. For indicating which endpoints/channels you want to read

    * Data. Each configured channel may have one or multiple entries,
      indicate which entries you want to read, and optionally inspect
      the data.

    * Plots. Create plots here.

    * Config. Save or load configuration files.

    The plots have controls to run, pause, pause&clear, or be
    edited. Only one plot can be edited at a time. When a plot is
    edited, lines can be added to the plot on the data page, just add
    a line with the line button, and then drag variables from the data
    view to the x or y field. If you drag the channel's tick, this
    will be converted to time with DUECA's current time granule.

    There is also an option to control the lines in the plot through a
    run-control channel; this channel has a variable that is 0 for
    pause, 1 for run, 2 for clearing; drag the runcontrol variable to
    the reset field; this allows for programmatic control of the
    plots, for example starting a new line when a new run is made. The
    eraser can be used to clear lines.

    A standard module, "PlotRunControl/plot-run-control", can be
    configured to start plots in Advance, and stop and clear them
    again in HoldCurrent mode.
