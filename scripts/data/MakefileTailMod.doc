This is a module directory of a DUECA application. This directory
contains the code to generate a single module. The following files and
directories are special:

  - module.o (generated), contains the compiled code for this module

  - html (generated), contains the html documentation, generated with
    doxygen. 

  - images (optional), directory for putting images you would want in
    the html documentation

  - comm-objects.lst, contains a list of communication objects used by
    this module. Use this list, do not include communication object
    header code directly in your files

  - comm-objects.h (generated), header file that references all
    communication object headers.

The various targets of this Makefile:

  clean     : normal cleaning (remove .o files)

  mrproper  : super cleaning, remove everything automatically
              generated

  doc       : generate documentation for the modules, for all module and
              the comm-objects directory "doc" subdirs are generated

  depend    : calculate dependencies and generate automatically
              generated code

  all       : make the module code

You will see just a small piece of this Makefile in your
directory. This piece can be tailored, specifically:

EXTRA_INCLUDES : add additional include paths and defines here

The following defines normally need not be changed:

CPPSRC      : all C++ source files in your module. By default, it uses
              all .cxx files in this directory, so normally you won't have
              to adjust this

CSRC	    : all C source files in your module, similarly takes all .c
              files by default

DUECATYPES  : all .dco files in your module. Note that you should keep
              all .dco files in the comm-objects directory, please do
              not change this definition unless you really have to,
              and really know what you are doing.
