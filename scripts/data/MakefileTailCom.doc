This is a comm-objects directory of a DUECA application. This directory
contains the code to generate the objects that are sent over channels
between modules. Note that this code is automatically generated from
files with a .dco (dUECA communication object) extension.

  - module.o (generated), contains the compiled code with the
    communication objects

  - doc (generated), contains the html documentation, generated with
    doxygen. 

  - comm-objects.lst, unused in comm-objects directories

The various targets of this Makefile:

  clean     : normal cleaning (remove .o files)

  mrproper  : super cleaning, remove everything automatically
              generated

  doc       : generate documentation for the modules, for all module and
              the comm-objects directory "doc" subdirs are generated

  depend    : calculate dependencies and generate automatically
              generated code

  all       : make the communication objects code

You will see just a small piece of this Makefile in your
directory. This piece can be tailored, specifically:

EXTRA_INCLUDES : add additional include paths and defines here

The following defines normally need not be changed:

DUECATYPES  : all .dco files in your module. Please do
              not change this definition unless you really have to,
              and really know what you are doing.
