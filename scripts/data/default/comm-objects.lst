# ("DCO" objects) needed by this module. 
# specify these with the .dco extension, examples:
#
# - for DCO files belonging to your own project, omit the project 
#   name, and write this as:
#
# comm-objects/MyDataObject.dco
#
# - for DCO files belonging to another project (i.e., borrowed), 
#   include the project name, for example:
#
# FlightDeckInterfaces/comm-objects/PrimaryControls.dco
