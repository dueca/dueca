This is the main directory ('project directory') of a DUECA
application. The various sub directories are:

  - comm-objects: a directory with "communication objects",
    definitions of classes that can be used to transport information
    between different DUECA modules
  
  - run: a directory with configuration data for running this
    application on different platforms. 

  - All other directories are (or should be) directories with DUECA
    modules. 

The various targets of this Makefile:

  clean     : normal cleaning (remove .o files)

  mrproper  : super cleaning, remove everything automatically
              generated
 
  doc       : generate documentation for the modules, for all module and
              the comm-objects directory "html" subdirs are generated

  depend    : calculate dependencies and generate automatically
              generated code

  all       : create application executable

  help      : generate this message

You will see just a small piece of this Makefile in your
directory. This piece can be tailored, specifically:

DCOMPONENTS : list the flags that determine your choice of dueca core
	      components, check the dueca-config script for options

COMMON_INCLUDES : common include flag and header files for all modules

EXTRALIBS   : provide additional libraries for linking.

EXTRALIBS2  : additional libraries that are linked *after* standard
              dueca libraries
