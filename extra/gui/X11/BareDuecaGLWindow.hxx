/** Advance definition */
struct BareDuecaGLWindow_XWindowData;

/** This class provides a barebones, simple GL canvas for you to draw
    on, as an alternative to the toolkit-integrated DuecaGLWindow. It
    will directly open a window in the native windowing environment of
    your system.

    You can use it to have a display that is synced to your graphics
    card retrace. In that case, either create a drawing class that
    derives from this BareDuecaGLWindow, or use double inheritance to
    derive a DUECA module also from this class.

    In your doCalculation routine, use the following basic
    pattern. You need two variables defined in your class,

    <ol>

    <li>claim_thread is a flag that indicates whether the
    drawing is in its own thread (a necessity for following the
    graphics card retrace) or not. Typically, you make this
    user-configurable. </li>

    <li>run_until is a TimeTickType, that is set in startModule and
    stopModule. Initialize to 0.</li>

    <li>have_to_open is a flag to remember to open the
    display. Initialize to true.</li>

    </ol>

    \code

    // at the start of your calculation loop:
    if (have_to_open) {
      canvas.openWindow();
      have_to_open = false;
    }

    // this loop is done continuously for running in a claimed thread,
    // once otherwise
    do {

      // if in an endless loop, record waiting for the next frame retrace and
      // the buffer swap
      if ( claim_thread ) {
        do_calc.logBlockingWait();
        canvas.waitSwap(); // or self->waitSwap();
        do_calc.logBlockingWaitOver();
      }

      // check the current simulation time, and determine how much time passed
      // since the clock ticked
      TimeTickType current_tick = SimTime::getTimeTick();
      int64_t frac = Ticker::single()->getUsecsSinceTick(current_tick);

      // get the latest data from the simulation
      try {
        // use StreamReaderLatest to get to your data.
        // if you can and need to, use the frac to extrapolate your data

        // calculation to get difference between writing (logical time) and
        // current time
        DataTimeSpec span(r.timeSpec().getValidityStart(), current_tick);
        double late = span.getDtInSeconds() + frac * 1e-6 + t_predict;

        // with that, update your canvas state, or your own state if
        // you inherited. For advanced simulations, use "late" to
        // extrapolate
      }

      // redraw the image
      canvas.redraw();

    }
    while (run_until >= SimTime::getTimeTick());
    \endcode

    startModule and stopModule need to be adjusted accordingly:

    \code
    void MyCode::startModule(const TimeSpec &time)
    {
      do_calc.switchOn(time);
      if (claim_thread) {
        run_until = MAX_TIMETICK;
        myalarm.requestAlarm(time.getValidityStart());
      }
    }

    // stop the module
    void MyCode::stopModule(const TimeSpec &time)
    {
      do_calc.switchOff(time);
      if (claim_thread) {
        run_until = time.getValidityEnd();
      }
    }
    /endcode

    By default run_until should be zero. myalarm and myclock give aperiodic and
    periodic activation, so in your header, add:

    \code
    PeriodicAlarm         myclock;
    AperiodicAlarm        myalarm;
    \endcode

    And depending on the mode, connect one or the other to your
    activity in your complete() method.

    \code
    if (claim_thread) {
      do_calc.setTrigger(myalarm);
    }
    else {
      do_calc.setTrigger(myclock);
    }
    \endcode

    Instead of triggering on the time of your own clock, you can of
    course also trigger on incoming data.

    Don't forget to adjust your clock's rate if you get passed a time spec

    \code
    bool MyCode::setTimeSpec(const TimeSpec& ts)
    {
      // a time span of 0 is not acceptable
      if (ts.getValiditySpan() == 0) return false;

      // specify the timespec to the activity
      myclock.changePeriodAndOffset(ts);
    }
    \endcode
