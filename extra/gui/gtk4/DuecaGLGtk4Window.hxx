/** Provides a DUECA shell around a window with a Gtk4 GtkGlarea.

    After deriving from this class, you should implement
    the GL drawing routine.

    You can also implement callbacks for reshape, initialisation and
    mouse and keyboard events, check DuecaGtkInteraction for these.

    Note that these GL windows are primarily for testing. Using e.g.
    BareDuecaGLWindow you will get a window with lower overhead, that can
    also be run in a separate thread, blocking for the graphics refresh.
    Use that for serious deployment, and the GTK version for testing.

    Also note that under "modern" desktops, you would get a Wayland
    window with the default gtk4 GLArea, and these use OpenGL ES, rather
    than the "classic" desktop OpenGL you might be used to. The shaders
    you use need to be compliant with ES, see 

    [this WikiPedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language)

    As far as I can tell it is not possible to mix this in the same
    DUECA process with X11 GL windows.
