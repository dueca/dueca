/** A DuecaGLCanvas is the interface between the DUECA world and
    OpenGL drawing. Independently of the windowing toolkit that is
    used -- provided that this toolkit is GL capable -- you can use
    the DuecaGLCanvas to open and manipulate a GL view.

    DuecaGLCanvas is not used for gtk3; to get this functionality,
    either use a full-gl DuecaGLWindow (which is implemented through
    X11 directly), or insert a GtkGLArea widget in your gtk code, and
    use the gtk3 version of DuecaGLWidget to get event callbacks and
    implement the GL drawing routine.

    Note that the toolkit usage depends on the inclusion of the proper
    code with DCOMPONENTS in your project's main Makefile, and the
    toolkit is selected with the make-environment call, in dueca.cnf.
