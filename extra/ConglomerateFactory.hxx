/** A simple factory, uses subcontractors to create objects. A key
    defines the class of the desired object, and the subcontractor who
    will create the object.

    What is a "Factory" in software engineering? It has become known as
    a pattern, a typical solution.

    The problem this factory was originally written for may serve as
    an illustration. I needed a way to flexibly add graphical objects
    to a scene graph visualization. The objects all behave similar in
    some respects (they are visible, have a location, can be moved
    around, stuff like that), but they are all slightly
    different. Some examples:

    <ul>
    <li> A skydome, that keeps itself centered over the "observer"
    viewpoint
    <li> Decorations in the world that simply stay put
    <li> Aircraft flying around that need to be controlled
    </ul>

    And I might want to extend the repertoire later. If you solve that
    "the classical" way, you have to add a case to your graphics code
    for each new type of object; e.g. add a model for the Citation
    with moving gear and control surfaces. That is something I wanted
    to avoid.

    The factory solves it in a different way. This factory has a
    "map", basically an array indexed with, for example, a string. The
    elements in the array point to "subsidiaries", pieces of code that
    are able to create an object of a desired type.

    If you want to add a model, now you simply create the code for the
    model (as before), and then you extend the factory by adding a
    "subsidiary", a supplier for your factory. There is a template to
    do that. Now, by simply adding your code to a project, the factory
    is automatically extended to include the new type of (graphical)
    object.

    There are a number of steps in creating a factory of your own:

    Step 1, define a specification of the types in your base
    product/spec class:

    \code
    struct MyKey
    {
      // the key type that differentiates the products/subsidiaries
      typedef std::string Key;
      // base type of the product (may be pointer, may be reference,
      // may be smart pointer)
      typedef MyProduct ProductBase;
      // base type / only type for specification (what product is made of)
      // must be flexible enough to produce all wanted products
      typedef MySpecification SpecBase;
    };
    \endcode

    This definition is typically used by a client of the factory. The
    exact type of product created is defined by the Key; usually a
    string-like type. Of course, replace My... etc by the thing you
    are actually interested in.

    Step 2, instantiate a factory with the base type as template
    parameter. You can use the singleton provided here, and the factory
    template

    \code
    typedef CFSingletonWrapper<
      ConglomerateFactory<
        MyKey,
        SubcontractorBase<MyKey>* > >
        MyNewFactory;
    \endcode

    It can be seen that here the subcontractors are stored as a pointer.

    Step 3, create a base class for your products. This class defines
    the interaction with the simulation, in the above example, with
    the state updating and object drawing code. In this example the
    base class has virtual functions to access the simulation data and
    interact with the scene graph code.

    Step 4, For each (family of) products, create a class derived from
    your base class, implementing the desired behaviour.

    The derived class should implement the following constructor:
    \code
    class MySpecificObject: public MyGenericObject
    {
      MySpecificObject(const MyKey::SpecBase& argument);
      ...
    };

    Note that the MyKey::SpecBase (or MySpecification) must be generic
    enough to be able create all derived objects. In some cases you might
    have to resort to strings with JSON or XML.

    Step 5, instantiate a subcontractor to the factory, using the
    CFSubcontractor template, e.g.

    \code
    static CFSubcontractor<MyKey, MySpecificObject, MyNewFactory>
      MySpecificObject_maker
        ("MySpecificObject",
         "Some illustrative information about this object");
    \endcode
