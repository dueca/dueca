/** Filing and retrieving object for replay data from a specific entity.

    Each entity's dueca::DDFFDataRecorder objects in a particular node
    connect to a matching filer. If the filer is not available yet, it
    is created based on the entity name passed by the
    DDFFDataRecorder. The filer sotres recorded data in a file, records
    starting and ending points for recording stretches, and enables
    the retrieval of the proper data stretches.

    For communication and control, the filer opens a pair of channels,
    connecting to the (central) ReplayMaster object.

    The file's composition is as follows:

    - A stream with the inventory of the file (stream 0), inherited from
      the FileWithInventory

    - A stream with data on recordings (Tag data, stream 1). This tag
      data includes some metadata, and records at which offset in the
      file data from each of the following streams starts. Tag data is
      written in msgpack array format, with the following contents:
      - array of int8, giving the offset values of the block with the
        first written data in a recording, in bytes from the start of
        the file.
      - array of int4, giving the offset values of the corresponding
        data, in bytes from the start of its block.
      - integer cycle, basically the recording number (unique)
      - integer index0, in DUECA a time tick for the start of recording
      - integer index1, a time tick for the end of recording
      - string with the absolute wall clock time of the recording
      - string with a name for an initial condition/state, if applicable
      - string with a label
      - float granule, value of a time tick, to check for timing compatibility

    - Further streams, as defined in the stream #0 inventory.
