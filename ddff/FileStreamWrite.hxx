/** FileStreamWrite, a writer class for file data.

    A "stream" is a series of linked blocks in a data file with the
    DelftDataFormat file format. This class writes such a stream, and
    can produce an iterator that can be used to add data to this
    stream.

    If multiple streams are to be written in a file, the very first
    stream functions as a repository of index data, indicating where
    other streams start and how they are labelled.
