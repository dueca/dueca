/** Object to open and manage a logging file, low-level API.

    This handles a file in the DelftDataFormat file format, which can
    contain multiple data streams. A "stream" is implemented as a
    series of linked blocks in this file.

    This class can return a writer for a new stream, or readers for
    a given stream.

    ## File format

    Block sizes are a multiple of a base block size, default 4096
    bytes, and for best performance chosen to match (be a multiple of)
    physical device block size.

    Each block has a 28-byte header, indicating next block location,
    block size, fill level, block number, stream id, checksum,
    etc. For the precise format see the description in
    ControlBlock.hxx. The remainder of the block contains data.

    ## Reading a stream

    For a stream, the starting block for reading is loaded with a
    FileStreamRead object. This object needs the offset of the first
    (or a later) block in the stream.

    A FileStreamRead object can issue an iterator, initially using the
    first loaded block of data (excluding the header). When the
    iterator reaches the end of the data in the loaded block, the next
    block, if available, will be loaded and used. To improve real-time
    performance, it is also possible to pre-load blocks of data.

    Before or after opening an existing file, create all needed read
    streams, and run checkIndices.

    ## Writing a stream

    A FileStreamWrite object can write a stream. It can issue an
    iterator, and will request file blocks from the FileHandler when
    needed.

    ## Alternating reading and writing.

    A file can be used for both reading and writing. After writing, an
    intermediate end can be written to a file by calling the
    syncToFile() function. A following call to runLoads() re-loads the
    necessary data into the FileStreamRead objects, which can then be
    used to read data.

    ## Further interface.

    A further elaboration of the interface is given in the
    dueca::ddff::FileWithInventory class. Here the #0 stream is
    reserved for information on named data streams, and the #1 stream
    is reserved for recording block offsets at points where stream
    reading may be started.

    ## Error robustness and recovery

    All blocks carry a checksum, calculated over the data and metadata
    (with the exception of the next block location). The metadata also
    contains (if so notified by the application) the offset for the
    first completely written written object in a block, where "object"
    can be defined by the application. This should enable partial
    recovery of data in the case of data corruption.
